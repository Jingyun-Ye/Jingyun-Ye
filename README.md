(updated 09/2024)

My name is Jingyun Ye. I have been a computational chemist with more than 10 years’ experience in advanced material design and development; I have 4 years data science experience in ML models development for material performance prediction. 

My expertise lies in computational modeling (DFT and MD), ML, Cheminformatics, structure-property relationship development, Data-Driven material design and discovery, Material Forecasting and Manufacturing Process Improvement. 

***Key Achievements***

•	Computationally developed a catalyst (In2o3) for converting CO2 to methanol, which has been validated by experiment that shows 100% selectivity and over 1000 hrs stability, 10 times more stable than the commercial catalyst. (ACS catalysis 3 (6), 1296-1306)

• Computationally designed a functionalized porous material which integrate the CO2 capture and conversion processes in a single material. This design was validated by multiple experimental groups. (ACS Catalysis 5 (5), 2921-2928, ACS Catalysis 5 (10), 6219-6229, Catalysis Science & Technology 6 (24), 8392-8405)

• Developed the first computational database of a family of metal free catalysts, which is called frustrated lewis pair. I combined machine learning for metal free catalysts discovery through large-scale computational screening. (https://jingyun-ye.github.io/FLPDB/ )

 ***Research Interests (Ph.D--Postdoc-Professor)***
 
•	Using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations and kinetic modeling to investigate the catalyst structures, reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics and kinetics of catalytic reactions at the molecular level.

•	Exploring structure–function relationships to identify the physical and chemical descriptors that govern catalytic activity for large-scale computational screening, and further guide catalysts design. 

•	Developing open-access database and combine Data Science, Machine Learning, Cheminformatics for the novel materials discovery.

The ultimate goal is to combine computational modeling and machine learning to precisely design multi-functional materials and efficient catalysts including metals, metal oxides, metal complexes, zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and covalent-organic frameworks for sustainable energy conversion and storage, such as CO2 capture and conversion, water splitting, natural gas conversion, polymerization.
