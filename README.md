**Jingyun Ye (Ph.D in Chemical Engineering)**

My name is Jingyun Ye. I have been a computational chemist with more than 10 years’ experience in advanced material design and development; I have 4 years data science experience in ML models development for material performance prediction. 

My expertise lies in computational modeling (DFT and MD), ML, Cheminformatics, structure-property relationship development, Data-Driven material design and discovery, Material Forecasting and Manufacturing Process Improvement. 

 ***Research Interests (Ph.D--Postdoc-Professor)***
 
•	Using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations and kinetic modeling to investigate the catalyst structures, reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics and kinetics of catalytic reactions at the molecular level.

•	Exploring structure–function relationships to identify the physical and chemical descriptors that govern catalytic activity for large-scale computational screening, and further guide catalysts design. 

•	Developing open-access database and combine Data Science, Machine Learning, Cheminformatics for the novel materials discovery.

The ultimate goal is to combine computational modeling and machine learning to precisely design multi-functional materials and efficient catalysts including metals, metal oxides, metal complexes, zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and covalent-organic frameworks for sustainable energy conversion and storage, such as CO2 capture and conversion, water splitting, natural gas conversion, polymerization.
